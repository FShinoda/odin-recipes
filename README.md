# Odin Recipes

This current project is a simple recipe website. 
It has the objective to test my initial HTML skills, learned on The Odin Project website.

In the future, I plan to make a proper UI/UX Design of my own (I'm learning UI/UX Design on Origamid courses) and add to it.
It will be added on another future branch, so my evolution can be compared afterwards.
